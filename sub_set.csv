For the most part it will just need to be put together, interior work and paint. The cost to us is $5,500 and we are looking for someone to finance this project. This is a fabulous offer and we would be idiots to this pass up. When completed, the value of the truck should be around $20,000. As it sits now, the value is actually around $7,500. Meaning that if we got this today we could sell it, as-is, tomorrow for $7,500. The current owner has fell onto hardship and cannot afford to complete this project.

Plan for use of funds:  I plan to use the funds to pay off our business line of credit, effectively refinancing it.  Our business is growing rapidly, and we need funds available to hire new employees and possibly get another vehicle.  What makes me a good borrower:  I have excellent credit and have never been delinquent on a payment.  I pay my obligations on time.  My income is more than adequate to cover the monthly cost of this loan.  My income & budget:  Our 2010 gross sales were $100,317, with net profits of $38,731.  Our personal household budget is $3000 per month and includes rent, utilities, insurance, groceries, and all other household expenses.  How stable is my income:  We have increased sales and net profits each year since we began in 2006.  We have 2 full time employees to help us, and we are bringing on a third employee in 2 weeks.  We are hiring a part time salesperson also.  Starting June 1st, we will begin a professional business growth coaching program.

What makes me a great borrower is the fact that the amount requested is small, my credit score and history is commendable, and my job (military) is very secure. Other than minimal living expenses, I have no other bills or debts to pay since my automobiles are owned which makes my debt-to-income ratio lean tremendously in my favor. My partner and I evenly divided rent and utilities. Since our income is substantial in comparison to our debt, the risk of defaulting or non-payment doesn't exist at all as we both take our credit standing and reports very seriously. I am thrifty in my spending habits. My partner is just as frugal. I budget myself to only buying the things I need like food and gas for my vehicle, and the occasional ice cream cone. My main hobby is running so I only spend money toward it when I have to buy new shoes which is only twice a year.<br/>",small_business,Hot Issue,735xx,OK,0.84,0.0,Mar-2002,2.0,,,4.0,0.0,425.0,6.6,16.0,f,0.0,0.0,14005.0,13892.96,12500.0,1505.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Jan-2011,7773.74,,Jun-2015,0.0,,1.0,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am the second most senior Social Worker in my Division and therefore, if there were to be any unforseen layoff's my position would be secure as less senior workers would experience layoff's. I am a dependable borrower as my credit has no deliquencies, and furthermore, I have never paid a student loan, or car payment in the last seven + years I have had these payments. My monthly budget is approximately 2,400-2,700 per month as I have additional income that comes to me outside of my salary for mileage expenses. I plan to use the amount of the loan I requested to consilidate some debt I incurred when purchasing new furniture earlier this year. I made the investment as I am looking to purchase a home in the next couple of years and wanted to start with furnishing to avoid lots of new expenses at once when I close on my own home in the future. I would like to have one easy payment to make a month, rather than a couple of payments in which the interest rates shot up in the last couple of months despite my good credit and timely payments. Any remaining funds from this loan would go towards fixing some damage to my car due to a hit and run. I would like to keep my car in the best possible condition so that when it is paid off it holds the most value possible. Thank you in advance for your consideration!<br/> Borrower added on 03/08/10 > Please note a type-o! In regards to paying student loans and car payments, I meant to write that I have never paid either late/delinquent!!

We used to travel around the Northeastern US visiting different state parks.  The time spent with my family were some of the best  I have experienced, I will always remember them fondly.  Now, I am grown and hoping to start a family someday soon and want to carry on this tradition.  <br/><br/>I went to the State Employee Credit Union, I have been with since I moved down to NC 7 years ago, but they did not put together very good terms.  Apparently because this is categorized as a Recreational Vehicle  the interest rate is higher than auto loans I have done with them in the past. So a friend recommended Lending Club and thought I would try here and see how it goes.<br/><br/>After typing in my personal information the current loan offered is appealing.  I also love the idea of supporting a community approach to financing.  <br/><br/>So, feel free to ask questions about my situation or anything that would make you feel more comfortable contributing to my dream!<br/><br/>Thanks for taking some time to review my loan and possibly contribute!<br/><br/>~Leanne<br/> Borrower added on 01/29/11 > I spent my youth with my family traveling the Northeastern US in a '74 Volkswagon Westfalia and enjoyed some of the best memories being all together.<br/><br/>The time we spent together was an invaluable way for me to get to know my parents and sibling - it was a great time.  Now I am older and wanting to start a family soon and want to recreate that experience for my children.  The best part is that as a guidance counselor I have my summers off to start these adventures.<br/><br/>Normally I would go to my Credit Union, which I have been a member since I moved down to NC 7 years ago.  Unfortunately because a Camper Van is classified as a recreational vehicle the interest rate they offered was unreasonably high.
